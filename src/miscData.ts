  bio: `Touseef is a frontend developer specializing in React.js, NextJS, Tailwindcss, and SCSS. His abilities go beyond just coding as he's a quick learner and has a large appetite for knowledge. He has good leadership skills and great communication skills as well.

  His role is to write and style the front-end components that meet the requirements of our mocks and fulfill our user stories.
  
  Touseef is an expert at structuring well-performing, easily-maintainable javascript frontend applications. He is also well-versed in modern web technologies.
  
  He has a knack for creating minimal websites. He has an eye for even the smallest of details like choosing colors, font sizes, images, etc. He is a big fan of simplicity and is a better team leader as compared to an individual contributor.
  
  Technologies I know/use: TailwindCSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, ReactJS/NextJS/GatsbyJS, GraphQL, Firebase
